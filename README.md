# Node NS API
A Node module that wraps around the NS.nl-Public-Travel-Information API.

More info about the API can be found here:
https://apiportal.ns.nl/

# Usage
To use this module you will have to create an API key at the NS API Portal.

Then call the API constructor like: `const api = new API('secret_key');`

# Existing modules
There was already a module to be found here https://github.com/fvdm/nodejs-ns-api, but this seemed out of date. That's why I made another one.
